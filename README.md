# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard

### 📊 Project Title: Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

In this project, I analyzed a telecom dataset to understand customer churn behavior. The project involved:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **SQL-Based Analysis** to extract key business insights
- **Power BI Dashboard** to visualize churn trends, customer segments, and high-risk users

🔍 Key Insights:
- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
- High monthly charges correlate with higher churn rates.
- Tenure is lower for churned customers, indicating early drop-offs.

✅ Tools Used:
Python, SQL, Power BI
